In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection, and Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

-Stacks are LIFO - Last In First Out data structure where the last value in is always the first one out.
-Stacks are used to handle function invocations (the call stack), for operations like undo/redo, and for routing (remember pages you have visited and go back/forward) and much more!
-They are not a built in data structure in JavaScript, but are relatively simple to implete, in some other languages it is built in
