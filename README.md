# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo is meant to keep and document my progress through Data Structures and Algorithms's courses and practices I have been working on.

I plan to structure each topic in its own folder along with a readme file containing extra notes on each. Ideally including Big O notation of each.

In the future whenever this material is ready and has been refactored I would like for it to serve as guidance for those navigating the challenging waters of Data Structures and Algorithms.
