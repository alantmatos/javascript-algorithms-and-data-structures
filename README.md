# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo is meant to keep and document my progress through Algorithms and Data Structures courses and practices I have been working on.

I plan to structure each topic in its own folder along with a readme file containing extra notes on each. Idealy including Big O evaluation on each data structure/algorithm.

In the future whenever this material is ready and have been refactored I would like for it to serve as guidance for those navigating the challengind waters of Data Structures and Algorithms.
