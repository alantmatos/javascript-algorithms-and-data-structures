# Hash Tables

- Are collections of key-value pairs.
- Can find values quickly given a key.
- Can add new key-values quickly.
- Store data in a large array and work by hashing the keys.
- A good hash should be fast, distribute keys uniformly, and be deterministic. 
- Separate chaining and linear probing are two strategies used to deal
with two keys that hasg to the same index ( collision );
